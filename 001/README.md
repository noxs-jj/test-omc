### Nothing is working, fill gaps and add unit tests

command: `go run main.go <income> <months>`

When was working, we saw following output

```
    make 001
    go run 001/main.go 1337 10
    income[1337] | months[10]
    with income[1337] and months:[10], result is [1551.64]
    EXIT_SUCCESS
```
